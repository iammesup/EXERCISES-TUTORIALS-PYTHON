Assume that a programmer works at the office from 9-5 pm. We have to take care of his health and remind him three things,
To drink a total of 3.5-liter water after some time interval between 9-5 pm.35 min
To do eye exercise after every 30 minutes.
To perform physical activity after every 45 minutes.

# Instructions:
The task is to create a program that plays mp3 audio until the programmer enters the input which implies that he has done the task.

For Water, the user should enter “drank”
For Eye Exercise, the user should enter “eyedone”
For Physical Exercise, the user should enter “exdone”
After the user entered the input, a file should be created for every task (one file), which contains the details about the time when the user performed a certain task.

# Challenge:
You will have to manage the clashes between the reminders. Such that no two reminders play at the same time.
Use pygame module to play audio.
If you are following the lectures regularly, then I'm sure you can complete the task in no time.

In order to play music/audio files in pygame, pygame.mixer is used (pygame module for loading and playing sounds).
This module contains classes for loading Sound objects and controlling playback. 
There are basically four steps in order to do so:
Starting the mixer
mixer.init()
Loading the song.
mixer.music.load("song.mp3")
Setting the volume.
mixer.music.set_volume(0.7)
Start playing the song.
mixer.music.play()
